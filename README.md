# OPL Cluster Editing Problem linear programming models

Linear programming models, written in the Optimization Programming Language (OPL), for Cluster Editing Problems. Two models are presented: A linear integer programming formulation for the original Cluster Editing Problem [2] and a linear integer programming for the p-Cluster Editing Problem [1].
